**Hi there! This is Culinary Explorer, a pretty neat Android app I've been "cooking up". If you're into cooking or want to cook but always stare blankly into your bridge, this app might just be for you.

**What can it do? The app is packed with some very nice feature although I wish I could add more:
✨ Today's Recipe: Stuck on what to make today? Get a fresh recipe suggestion right when you open the app everyday. No more decision fatigue. You also get suggestions of recipes that are similar to the featured recipe.
🔍 Advanced Search: Got some ingredients in mind? Don't remember the full name of the dish you want to cook? Don't worry since the search feature is there to help you with search suggestions and filtering, sorting options.
  Allergic to peanuts? Don't want to eat meat? The advanced search's filtering feature is there for you.
💾 Caching magic: Constantly losing access to the internet is no longer a major problem since you can still get access to the app if recently logged in and can see saved, favorite recipes with caching magic
📸 My Cooked Dishes & Dish Memories: This is my favorite feature. You can either cook an online recipe or create your own recipe, then add your own photos, rating, and notes everytime you try to cook it.
📅 Meal Planner: Help you plan your next meals for the upcoming days and you can also see what you had from previous days.

**Frameworks, architectures, and packages being used: Jetpack Compose (UI, navigation), Firebase (Storage, Firestore, Authentication), Coil (for caching images, loading images smoothly), Room database

**How to use the project: go to "https://spoonacular.com/food-api/apps" and generate your own Spoonacular Api key, then paste it to API_KEY value in SpoonacularApiService.kt under mycookingapp/data/network/

🎉🎉🎉 Happy Cooking!!! 🎉🎉🎉
