dark mode, global filter for users in case they hate something, fonts, other accessibility features

According to Gemini we can have
Here are some ideas for settings, categorized for clarity:
1. Appearance & Display:•Dark Mode / Theme:•Options: Light, Dark, System Default. (This is a must-have for modern apps).•Font Size:•Allow users to adjust the font size for recipes and other text for better readability (e.g., Small, Medium, Large, or a slider).•Recipe Layout:•Potentially offer different views for the recipe detail screen, e.g., "Compact View" (less spacing, more info on screen) vs. "Spacious View" (more white space, larger images). (This is a more advanced feature).•Show/Hide Recipe Images in Lists:•For users on limited data or who prefer faster scrolling, an option to hide images in recipe listing screens (like search results or category lists) could be useful.
2. Units & Measurement:•Default Measurement System:•Options: Metric (grams, mL), Imperial (ounces, cups), or even specific regional variations if your app targets a global audience.•This would affect how recipe ingredients are displayed by default. (Ideally, individual recipes might also allow toggling if the data supports it).•Temperature Units:•Options: Celsius, Fahrenheit.
3. Dietary Preferences & Exclusions (Global Settings):•Global Diet Filters:•Allow users to set persistent dietary preferences (e.g., Vegetarian, Vegan, Gluten-Free, Dairy-Free).•These could then influence search results, suggestions, or highlight suitable recipes.•Note: This is different from the per-recipe suggestions you just implemented. This would be a more general, app-wide filter or preference.•Allergen Exclusions:•A list of common allergens (e.g., Nuts, Shellfish, Soy) that users can select. The app could then warn or filter out recipes containing these. (This requires good quality recipe data).
4. Notifications:•New Recipe Suggestions:•Toggle on/off notifications for new featured recipes or personalized suggestions.•Cooking Timer Reminders:•If your app includes in-recipe timers, allow users to customize reminder sounds or vibration.•Updates & Announcements:•Notifications for app updates or important news (use sparingly).
5. Data & Storage:•Clear Cache:•Option to clear cached images and recipe data to free up storage space.•Offline Data Management (if applicable):•If you implement offline recipe saving, settings to manage downloaded recipes, see storage usage, etc.•Sync Settings (if you have cloud sync for user data like favorites or cooked dishes):•Sync now, sync frequency (e.g., Wi-Fi only, background sync on/off).
6. Account & Profile (if you have user accounts):•Edit Profile: (Username, email - though email change often has security implications)•Change Password•Manage Saved Payment Methods (if you have premium features/subscriptions)•Delete Account•Sign Out
7. Content & Experience:•Default Search Filters:•Allow users to set default filters that are applied every time they search (e.g., max cooking time, specific cuisines they always prefer).•Smart Suggestions Level:•If your suggestion algorithm becomes sophisticated, you might offer levels like "Show me more variety" vs. "Stick to my favorites." (Advanced)•"What's New" / Changelog:•A link to a screen showing recent app updates and new features.
8. About & Support:•About App: (Version number, credits, acknowledgments)•Help / FAQ•Contact Support / Send Feedback•Rate App•Privacy Policy•Terms of Service•Open Source LicensesHow to Decide What to Include:•Start Simple: Don't overwhelm users. Begin with the most impactful settings (like Dark Mode, Units).•User Needs: Think about what would genuinely make the app more convenient or personalized for someone who cooks regularly.•App Features: Your settings will naturally grow as your app's feature set expands. If you add meal planning, you'll need settings for meal planning notifications, default grocery list sorting, etc.•Data Availability: Some settings (like fine-grained allergen filtering) depend heavily on the quality and detail of your recipe data.•Technical Feasibility: Implement settings that you can reliably support.Recommendation for "MyCookingApp" to start:1.Dark Mode (Light, Dark, System)2.Default Measurement System (Metric, Imperial)3.Temperature Units (Celsius, Fahrenheit)4.Notifications (e.g., for new recipe suggestions - simple on/off to start)5.Clear Cache6.About Section (Version, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)Then, as you gather user feedback and add more features, you can expand this list.
